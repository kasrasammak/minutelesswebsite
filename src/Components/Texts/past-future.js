                <div>Collaborative release with Metacortex Records<br></br><br></br></div>
                <div>Mastering by Ioannis Karapostolis of Tenebral Cortex<br></br>
                With the exception of track 05. K-Owl - Melting Plastic Mind, which is self-mastered<br></br><br></br></div>

                Traditionally rhythm takes shape by repetition of similar sounds which change slightly at uniform time intervals. <br></br>
                Since the early ages, people exploited this repetition to elaborate their emotions and thoughts in some order,<br></br> 
                in order to make sense of the passing time in their personal reality.<br></br>
                While each moment may be unique and incomparable, <br></br>
                the rhythm provides an order that fosters some sense of security.<br></br><br></br>
                </div>
                <div>So what happens when we alter that rhythms structure? <br></br>
                Upon our first encounter with such unfamiliar rhythms, <br></br>
                the music typically prods the human psyche and provokes the stability of the ego. <br></br>
                This can be very troubling for the human kind, <br></br>
                as it is in our nature to identify with familiar patterns, <br></br>
                and prediction is at the very roots of perception. <br></br>
                Introducing unfamiliarity can leave humans subconsciously disarmed and unguarded.<br></br><br></br></div>
            
                <div>
                However, the mind has a strong sense of plasticity. <br></br>
                It is always looking to classify and organize, and when faced with new and erring information,<br></br>
                the mind has an amazing capacity to restructure itself to make room for challenging information. <br></br><br></br>
                </div>
                <div>Over time, unpredictable rhythms in music prompt the reexamination of the ego, <br></br>
                and ultimately reveal a new way to appreciate the art form. <br></br>
                The very notion of rhythm is as such transformed, <br></br>
                which subsequently strengthens the psyche as one learns to confront these new structures. <br></br>
                One must restructure their own sense of prediction and pattern recognition to embrace this new reality.<br></br> 
                In a way, this fosters a new platform of possibility in music and in the mind. <br></br>
                It induces a state of readiness for the unknown and entrenchment in the moment, <br></br>
                which could potentially play an important role in intellectual development.<br></br><br></br></div>
                <div>
                The artists on this compilation work on this structure at the most fundamental levels. <br></br>
                In an attempt to surprise themselves in music, <br></br>
                they expand their repertoire of familiar patterns for themselves and their listeners.<br></br> <br></br>
                Past Future is a collaborative release between Metacortex Records and Minuteless Recordings. <br></br>
                With its 12 experimental tracks, this compilation designs the moment peculiarly <br></br>
                by presenting rhythm and time on a timeless platform at an unpredictable reality. <br></br><br></br>
                Time is no longer on a straight line where the past is behind you and the future forward, <br></br>
                yet the moment is unquestionably at the center of time. <br></br>
                So, without further ado, we present to you this moment.
